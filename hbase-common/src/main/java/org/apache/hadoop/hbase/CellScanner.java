comment|/**  * An interface for iterating through a sequence of cells. Similar to Java's Iterator, but without  * the hasNext() or remove() methods. The hasNext() method is problematic because it may require  * actually loading the next object, which in turn requires storing the previous object somewhere.  *  *<p>The core data block decoder should be as fast as possible, so we push the complexity and  * performance expense of concurrently tracking multiple cells to layers above the CellScanner.  *<p>  * The {@link #current()} method will return a reference to a Cell implementation. This reference  * may or may not point to a reusable cell implementation, so users of the CellScanner should not,  * for example, accumulate a List of Cells. All of the references may point to the same object,  * which would be the latest state of the underlying Cell. In short, the Cell is mutable.  *</p>  * Typical usage:  *  *<pre>  * while (scanner.advance()) {  *   Cell cell = scanner.current();  *   // do something  * }  *</pre>  *<p>Often used reading {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.Cell}s written by  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.CellOutputStream}.  */
