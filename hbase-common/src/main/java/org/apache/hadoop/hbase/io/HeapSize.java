comment|/**  * Implementations can be asked for an estimate of their size in bytes.  *<p>  * Useful for sizing caches.  Its a given that implementation approximations  * do not account for 32 vs 64 bit nor for different VM implementations.  *<p>  * An Object's size is determined by the non-static data members in it,  * as well as the fixed {@link Object} overhead.  *<p>  * For example:  *<pre>  * public class SampleObject implements HeapSize {  *  *   int [] numbers;  *   int x;  * }  *</pre>  */
