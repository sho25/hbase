comment|/**  *<p>Used to communicate with a single HBase table similar to {@link Table} but meant for  * batched, asynchronous puts. Obtain an instance from a {@link Connection} and call  * {@link #close()} afterwards. Customizations can be applied to the {@code BufferedMutator} via  * the {@link BufferedMutatorParams}.  *</p>  *  *<p>Exception handling with asynchronously via the {@link BufferedMutator.ExceptionListener}.  * The default implementation is to throw the exception upon receipt. This behavior can be  * overridden with a custom implementation, provided as a parameter with  * {@link BufferedMutatorParams#listener(BufferedMutator.ExceptionListener)}.</p>  *  *<p>Map/Reduce jobs are good use cases for using {@code BufferedMutator}. Map/reduce jobs  * benefit from batching, but have no natural flush point. {@code BufferedMutator} receives the  * puts from the M/R job and will batch puts based on some heuristic, such as the accumulated size  * of the puts, and submit batches of puts asynchronously so that the M/R logic can continue  * without interruption.  *</p>  *  *<p>{@code BufferedMutator} can also be used on more exotic circumstances. Map/Reduce batch jobs  * will have a single {@code BufferedMutator} per thread. A single {@code BufferedMutator} can  * also be effectively used in high volume online systems to batch puts, with the caveat that  * extreme circumstances, such as JVM or machine failure, may cause some data loss.</p>  *  *<p>NOTE: This class replaces the functionality that used to be available via  * {@link HTableInterface#setAutoFlush(boolean)} set to {@code false}.  *</p>  *  *<p>See also the {@code BufferedMutatorExample} in the hbase-examples module.</p>  * @see ConnectionFactory  * @see Connection  * @since 1.0.0  */
