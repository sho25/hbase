comment|/**  * The replication listener interface can be implemented if a class needs to subscribe to events  * generated by the ReplicationTracker. These events include things like addition/deletion of peer  * clusters or failure of a local region server. To receive events, the class also needs to register  * itself with a Replication Tracker.  */
