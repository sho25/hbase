This maven module has the protobuf definition files used by REST.

The produced java classes are generated and then checked in. The reasoning is
that they change infrequently.

To regenerate the classes after making definition file changes, in here or over
in hbase-protocol since we source some of those protos in this package, ensure
first that the protobuf protoc tool is in your $PATH. You may need to download
it and build it first; it is part of the protobuf package. For example, if using
v2.5.0 of protobuf, it is obtainable from here:

 https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v2.5.0

You can compile the protoc definitions by invoking maven with profile compile-protobuf
or passing in compile-protobuf property.

 $ mvn compile -Dcompile-protobuf
or
 $ mvn compile -Pcompile-protobuf

You may also want to define protocExecutable for the protoc binary

 $ mvn compile -Dcompile-protobuf -DprotocExecutable=/opt/local/bin/protoc

After you've done the above, check it in and then check it in (or post a patch
on a JIRA with your definition file changes and the generated files).
