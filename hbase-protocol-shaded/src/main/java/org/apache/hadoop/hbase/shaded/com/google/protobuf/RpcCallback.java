comment|/**  * Interface for an RPC callback, normally called when an RPC completes.  * {@code ParameterType} is normally the method's response message type.  *  *<p>Starting with version 2.3.0, RPC implementations should not try to build  * on this, but should instead provide code generator plugins which generate  * code specific to the particular RPC implementation.  This way the generated  * code can be more appropriate for the implementation in use and can avoid  * unnecessary layers of indirection.  *  * @author kenton@google.com Kenton Varda  */
