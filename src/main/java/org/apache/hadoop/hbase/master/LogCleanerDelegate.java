comment|/**  * Interface for the log cleaning function inside the master. By default, two   * cleaners:<code>TimeToLiveLogCleaner</code> and   *<code>ReplicationLogCleaner</code> are called in order. So if other   * effects are needed, implement your own LogCleanerDelegate and add it to the  * configuration "hbase.master.logcleaner.plugins", which is a comma-separated  * list of fully qualified class names. LogsCleaner will add it to the chain.  *  *<p>HBase ships with LogsCleaner as the default implementation.  *  *<p>This interface extends Configurable, so setConf needs to be called once  * before using the cleaner.  * Since LogCleanerDelegates are created in LogsCleaner by reflection. Classes  * that implements this interface should provide a default constructor.  */
