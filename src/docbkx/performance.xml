        It has a general discussion of the main factors involved; RAM, compression, JVM settings, etc.

            In his presentation,
            <link xlink:href="http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/hbase-hug-presentation">Avoiding Full GCs with MemStore-Local Allocation Buffers</link>,
            Todd Lipcon describes two cases of stop-the-world garbage collections common in HBase, especially during loading;
            CMS failure modes and old generation heap fragmentation brought.  To address the first,
            start the CMS earlier than default by adding <code>-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction</code>
            and setting it down from defaults.  Start at 60 or 70 percent (The lower you bring down
            the threshold, the more GCing is done, the more CPU used).  To address the second
            fragmentation issue, Todd added an experimental facility that must be 
            explicitly enabled in HBase 0.90.x (Its defaulted to be on in 0.92.x HBase).  See
            <code>hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled</code> to true in your
            <classname>Configuration</classname>.  See the cited slides for background and
            detail.
