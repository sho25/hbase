              <para>We assume that the Master will not fail until after the
              <code>OFFLINE</code> nodes have been created in ZK.

              <para>If the RS did not successfully open a region, the
              RegionManager or MasterPlanner will notice that the OFFLINE (or
              OPENING) node in ZK has not been updated. This will trigger a
              re-assignment to a different server. This logic is not special
              to startup, all assignments will eventually time out if the
              destination server never proceeds.</para>

              <para>If the Master fails (after creating the ZK nodes), the

        <title>Table Enable/Disable</title>

        <para>Users can enable and disable tables manually. This is done to

        <note>
          <para>Because all failover logic is designed to ensure assignment of
          all regions in transition, these operations will not properly ride
          over Master or RegionServer failures. Since these are
          client-triggered operations, this should be okay for the initial
          master design. Moving forward, a special node could be put in ZK to
          denote that a enable/disable has been requested. Another option is
          to persist region movement plans into ZK instead of just in-memory.
          In that case, an empty destination would signal that the region
          should not be reopened after being closed.</para>

        <para>There are some complexities here. For regions in transition that

          <listitem>
            <para><code>CLOSED</code> If the failed RS is the source, we can

        <para>In all of these cases, it is important to note that the
        transitions on the RS side ensure only a single RS ever successfully
        completes a transition. This is done by reading the current state,
        verifying it is expected, and then issuing the update with the version
        number of the read value. If multiple RSs are attempting this
        operation, exactly one can succeed.</para>

      <title>How EOFExceptions are treated when splitting a crashed
      RegionServers' WALs </title>

      <para>If we get an EOF while splitting logs, we proceed with the split
      even when <varname>hbase.hlog.split.skip.errors</varname> ==
      <constant>false</constant>. An EOF while reading the last log in the set
      of files to split is near-guaranteed since the RegionServer likely
      crashed mid-write of a record. But we'll continue even if we got an EOF
      reading other than the last file in the set.<footnote>
