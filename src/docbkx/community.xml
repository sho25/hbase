        <title>Feature Branches</title>
        <para>Feature Branches are easy to make.  You do not have to be a committer to make one.  Just request the name of your branch be added to JIRA up on the
        developer's mailing list and a committer will add it for you.  Thereafter you can file issues against your feature branch in HBase JIRA.  Your code you
        keep elsewhere -- it should be public so it can be observed -- and you can update dev mailing list on progress.   When the feature is ready for commit,
        3 +1s from committers will get your feature merged<footnote><para>See <link xlink:href="http://search-hadoop.com/m/uPNz32C5FkS1&amp;subj=Re+Thoughts+about+large+feature+dev+branches">HBase, mail # dev - Thoughts about large feature dev branches</link></para></footnote>
