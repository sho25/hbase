comment|/**  * Implementations are installed on a Replication Sink called from inside  * ReplicationSink#replicateEntries to filter replicated WALEntries based off WALEntry attributes.  * Currently only table name and replication write time are exposed (WALEntry is a private,  * internal class so we cannot pass it here). To install, set  *<code>hbase.replication.sink.walentryfilter</code> to the name of the implementing  * class. Implementing class must have a no-param Constructor.  *<p>This filter is of limited use. It is better to filter on the replication source rather than  * here after the edits have been shipped on the replication sink. That said, applications such  * as the hbase-indexer want to filter out any edits that were made before replication was enabled.  * @see org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.WALEntryFilter for filtering on the replication  * source-side.  */
