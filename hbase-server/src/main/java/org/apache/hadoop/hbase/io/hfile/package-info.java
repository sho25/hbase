comment|/**  * Provides implementations of {@link HFile} and HFile  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.BlockCache}.  Caches are configured (and instantiated)  * by {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig}.  See head of the  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig} class for constants that define  * cache options and configuration keys to use setting cache options.  Cache implementations  * include the on-heap {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.LruBlockCache},  * a {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.slab.SlabCache} that can serve as an L2 for  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.LruBlockCache}, and a  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.bucket.BucketCache} that has a bunch of deploy types  * including L2 for LRUBlockCache or using  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CombinedBlockCache}, as  * host for data blocks with meta blocks in the LRUBlockCache as well as onheap, offheap, and  * file options).  *   *<h1>Enabling {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.slab.SlabCache}</h2>  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.slab.SlabCache} has seen little use and will likely  * be deprecated in the near future.  To enable it,  * set the float<code>hbase.offheapcache.percentage</code> to some value between 0 and 1. This  * enables {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.DoubleBlockCache}, a facade over  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.LruBlockCache} and  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.slab.SlabCache}.  The value set here will be  * multiplied by whatever the setting for<code>-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize</code> is and this is what  * will be used by {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.slab.SlabCache} as its offheap store.  */
