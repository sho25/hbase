comment|/**  * Provides implementations of {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.HFile} and HFile  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.BlockCache}.  Caches are configured (and instantiated)  * by {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig}.  See head of the  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig} class for constants that define  * cache options and configuration keys to use setting cache options. Cache implementations  * include the default, native on-heap {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.LruBlockCache} and a  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.bucket.BucketCache} that has a bunch of deploy formats  * including acting as a L2 for LruBlockCache -- when a block is evicted from LruBlockCache, it  * goes to the BucketCache and when we search a block, we look in both places -- or  * using {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CombinedBlockCache}, BucketCache is used as  * a host for data blocks with meta blocks in an instance of LruBlockCache.  BucketCache  * can also be onheap, offheap, and file-backed.  *   *<h1>Which BlockCache should I use?</h1>  * By default LruBlockCache is on.  If you would like to cache more, and offheap, try enabling  * BucketCache. Fetching will always  * be slower when fetching from BucketCache but latencies tend to be less erratic over time  * (roughly because GC is less). See Nick Dimiduk's  *<a href="http://www.n10k.com/blog/blockcache-101/">BlockCache 101</a> for some numbers.  *  *<h1>Enabling {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.bucket.BucketCache}</h2>  * Read the options and defaults for BucketCache in the head of the  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig}.  *   *<p>Here is a simple example of how to enable a<code>4G</code> offheap bucket cache with 1G  * onheap cache managed by {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CombinedBlockCache}.  * CombinedBlockCache will put DATA blocks in the BucketCache and META blocks -- INDEX and BLOOMS  * -- in an instance of the LruBlockCache. For the  * CombinedBlockCache (from the class comment), "[t]he smaller lruCache is used  * to cache bloom blocks and index blocks, the larger bucketCache is used to  * cache data blocks. getBlock reads first from the smaller lruCache before  * looking for the block in the bucketCache. Metrics are the combined size and  * hits and misses of both caches."  To disable CombinedBlockCache and have the BucketCache act  * as a strict L2 cache to the L1 LruBlockCache (i.e. on eviction from L1, blocks go to L2), set  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig#BUCKET_CACHE_COMBINED_KEY} to false. By  * default, hbase.bucketcache.combinedcache.enabled (BUCKET_CACHE_COMBINED_KEY) is true.  *   *<p>Back to the example of setting an onheap cache of 1G and offheap of 4G with the BlockCache  * deploy managed by CombinedBlockCache. Setting hbase.bucketcache.ioengine and  * hbase.bucketcache.size> 0 enables CombinedBlockCache.  * In<code>hbase-env.sh</code> ensure the environment  * variable<code>-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize</code> is enabled and is bigger than 4G, say 5G in size:  * e.g.<code>-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=5G</code>. This setting allows the JVM use offheap memory  * up to this upper limit.  Allocate more than you need because there are other consumers of  * offheap memory other than BlockCache (for example DFSClient in the RegionServer uses offheap).  * In<code>hbase-site.xml</code> add the following configurations:<pre>&lt;property>&lt;name>hbase.bucketcache.ioengine&lt;/name>&lt;value>offheap&lt;/value>&lt;/property>&lt;property>&lt;name>hbase.bucketcache.percentage.in.combinedcache&lt;/name>&lt;value>0.8&lt;/value>&lt;/property>&lt;property>&lt;name>hbase.bucketcache.size&lt;/name>&lt;value>5120&lt;/value>&lt;/property></pre>.  Above we set a cache of 5G, 80% of which will be offheap (4G) and 1G onheap  * (with DATA blocks in BucketCache and INDEX blocks in the onheap LruBlockCache).  * Restart (or rolling restart) your cluster for the configs to take effect.  Check logs to ensure  * your configurations came out as expected.  *  */
